Introduction
============

This document describes the properties present on the JsonObjectLite result object returned from
Wilt API calls whether future or completion based. The future based API returns the result as
a parameter, the completion API assumes the client will get the result object from Wilt using
the completionResponse getter. 

Either way the result object will contain the following properties :-

error  - true if CouchDB or HTTP has returned an error. Note that this does not include
         CouchDb responses such as conflict, these are not server/transport errors as
         such and may in fact be valid responses.

errorCode - HTTP error code, set if error is true.

errorText - HTTP/CouchDB error text, set if error is true.

errorAsJson - has the 'error' and 'reason' properties, set if error is true.

method - The operation type, see the predifined Wilt constants.

allResponseHeader - the HTTP response headers.

responseText - the raw response text for browser clients or body for server clients

jsonCouchResponse - a JsonObject containing the following if error is false :-
                    ok - true if an attachment
                    contentType - set if an attachment
                    The response from CouchDb, note that this is the object you can
                    pass to WiltUserUtils to maniplulate document ids, revisions etc.
                    
                    
The test suite contains many examples of the usage of this interface, especially see the
results returned form bulk inserts and attachment tests to see a more detailed breakdown of
this object.

Basic usage is :-

if ( res.error ) {

         /* Process the error */
         jsonobject.JsonObject errorResponse = res.jsonCouchResponse;
         String errorText = errorResponse.error;
         String reasonText = errorResponse.reason;
         int statusCode = res.errorCode;
         return;
       }
       
       /* Get the success response*/
       jsonobject.JsonObject successResponse = res.jsonCouchResponse;
       .... do other stuff
